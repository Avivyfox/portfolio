        <h2>Description</h2>
        <br/>
        <h3> For this project, I created a 20-second public service announcement about plastic waste and ocean pollution using Adobe After Effects. I chose a lotion bottle as the central object, connecting it to earlier projects, to represent single-use plastic. The animation follows the bottle as it sinks to the bottom of the ocean, affecting various marine animals along its path.</h3>
        <h3>The aim was to raise awareness of the environmental impact of everyday plastic through a short, visually engaging infomercial-style video. This project allowed me to work with motion design, animation, and storytelling, while keeping a consistent visual theme across multiple pieces.</h3>

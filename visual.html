        <br/>
        <h3> For this project, I was tasked with developing a complete visual identity for a UNESCO World Heritage site. I chose Olympic National Park in Washington State, drawing inspiration from the park’s rich natural landscapes. I created a cohesive brand system using earthy color palettes and graphic illustrations of local landmarks such as forests, mountain ranges, and “Mount Deception.”</h3>
        <h3>The final identity includes a custom wordmark and logo, along with a curated type system and style guide to ensure brand consistency across all materials. I applied this identity across a variety of deliverables, including a redesigned website layout, merchandise concepts like sweatshirts, business cards, and a social media profile mockup for Twitter (now X). This project highlights not only my branding skills, but also my ability to execute design systems across both print and digital platforms.</h3>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <br/>
        <h3> This project is an interactive clock built with P5.js, inspired by a post-apocalyptic world where nature has reclaimed the environment and traditional clocks no longer exist. Instead of showing time in a conventional way, the clock represents a daylight cycle—featuring sunrise, sunset, and nighttime transitions—to reflect the natural passage of time.</h3>
        <h3>Different animals appear throughout the day, such as a bear and bird during daylight hours, and a raccoon at night. These animals emerge based on whether the current hour or minute is odd or even, giving users a subtle and creative way to interpret time. I also added ambient sound effects that change with the time of day, including cicadas in the evening and crickets at night, to enhance the immersive experience.</h3>
        <h3>While the core functionality is in place, this project is still a work in progress. I plan to complete the hand-drawn animations for the animals and replace the temporary Adobe Stock background with an original illustration to fully bring this world to life.</h3>

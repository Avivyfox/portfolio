        <h2>Description</h2>
         <br/>
        <h3> For this project, I designed a cohesive set of nine related icons, all based on a single starting object—a bottle of lotion. From there, I chose hiking and the outdoors as my theme and developed a series of icons representing essential items for an outdoor adventure.</h3>
        <h3>The final set includes icons for a water bottle, binoculars, backpack, hiking boots, sun hat, sunscreen, s’mores, flashlight, and camera. Each icon was carefully designed to maintain consistent line weight, detail level, and visual balance, ensuring they work together as a unified set. The goal was to create icons that feel visually connected while still clearly representing each individual object.</h3>
        <h3>This project highlights my attention to detail, precision in icon design, and ability to build visual harmony across a series.</h3>

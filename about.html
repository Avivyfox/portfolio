      <h3>I’m a multidisciplinary designer currently studying at Rutgers University’s Mason Gross School of the Arts, with a focus in Design. My work lives at the intersection of nature, media, and storytelling, drawing inspiration from the organic world as much as from technology and video games.</h3>
      <h3>I grew up with art as a constant in my life, and over time my creative interests have expanded to include graphic design, web development, and illustration. While I work primarily in digital and design-based mediums, I still love exploring fine art and drawing as a personal practice. Illustration, in particular, feels like a sweet spot between structured design and expressive art, and it's a medium I’m always eager to experiment with.</h3>
      <h3>Whether I’m coding an interactive project, designing a printed piece, or sketching in a notebook, I approach each project with curiosity, intention, and a drive to create something thoughtful.</h3>

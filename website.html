        <h2>Description</h2>
        <br/>
        <h3>  For this project, I selected a poem that matched a futuristic world I created and built an interactive webpage entirely with HTML code. I learned how to use hyperlinks to let viewers navigate between different verses of the poem, which are spaced throughout the page for a layered reading experience.</h3>
        <h3>The setting is a brick building overgrown with nature, reflecting a post-apocalyptic world where a group of survivors is hiding. I illustrated the background and custom images, including interactive elements. Users can open the door at the bottom of the page to discover the hidden people inside and shine a flashlight through certain windows to find babies and clues within the building. All interactions are coded directly in HTML, creating a simple but immersive experience.</h3>
        <h3>This project helped me explore both web design and interactive storytelling, and I plan to continue developing it by adding more interactive windows and visual details to deepen the world I built.</h3>

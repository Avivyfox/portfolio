        <h2>Description</h2>
     <br/>
        <h3> For this project, I designed and coded a custom Arduino instrument, imagined as something built from scrap electronics in a post-apocalyptic world. The idea was to create a sound board that feels handmade and experimental, using limited resources but still capable of producing interesting electronic beats.</h3>
        <h3>The instrument includes a button-based piano where users can adjust note pitch and duration, offering flexibility in the kinds of sounds that can be created. It also features a theremin-like function that responds to motion and can be turned on or off to keep it from becoming too distracting during use. This added element allows for more textural sound layers and encourages creative play.</h3>
        <h3>This project combined both hardware and software design, using Arduino to explore sound interaction in a hands-on, DIY context. It reflects both the resourcefulness of the world it was made for and my interest in building functional, imaginative tools from the ground up.</h3>
